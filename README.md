## Intro

- Practice C#
- Know how a terminal editor like vim works
- Edit texts using the editor I've written myself feels.. weird, in a good way

## Feature

- Fill blank lines with `~`s
- Show how many lines were there
- Ctrl+S for save
- Ctrl+F for basic search
- Ctrl+Q for quit (three times required if having unsaved changes)

## Roadmap

- [ ] Configurable *Find* (like *Ignore Case or not*)
- [ ] Syntax Highlighting (this might take a while..)

## Status

> Now I'm quite familiar with the project, I could start trying to integrate my own ideas into this editor implementation. I've also found a project that quite peaked my interest, which is [*Matt Duck*](https://www.mattduck.com/)'s improved version of the [implementation](https://github.com/mattduck/kilo). Hell yeah!
